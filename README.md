# Leonardo's portfolio

## Project description
This is the github page for my portfolio. Here you can see the code for my website, currently hosted [here](https://portfolio-leo-three.vercel.app).

This portfolio is a simple front-end that is meant to group and briefly explain all the projects I have worked on, either when learning to use a framework/library, personal projects or works for my clients.

### Frameworks used
For this website, I have used [Next.js Framework](https://nextjs.org/) with [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) for responsiveness. For more information on its development, please refer to the "Projects" section in the portfolio. Since I have previously worked with react framework, I decided to use a react-based framework, and seeing that Next.js and Tailwind are one of the most used frameworks, I believe that they will most likely going to be required if I work with front-end development.

### Current status and future steps
For now I have set up the environment to work on the website and deploying it (with vercel's preview). 
The next steps will be:
1. Creating my home page, which will be similar to this Readme
2. Creating a [navigation bar](https://tailwindui.com/components/application-ui/navigation/navbars)
3. Creating the other pages (About me, Projects, Contact me)
4. Adding [multi-language support](https://locize.com/blog/next-13-app-dir-i18n/) (English, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish)
5. Creating the page for each project
6. [Improving SEO](https://nextjs.org/learn/seo/introduction-to-seo)
